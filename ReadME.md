Main Idea of this applicaiton comes from similar flask driven application in conjunction with MySQL BY [mh-salari](https://github.com/mh-salari)

It has been renovated by Django and JavaScript to this Webapp interface.

To run the Fenjan porject do these:

1. (Optional) Create a fresh environment.
2. Install list of requirements.txt
3. Donwnload the repository into the local
4. (Optional) To start with a fresh database delete the Sqlite.db and follow the below:
   `python manage.py makemigrations`
   `python manage.py migrate`
5. On the root directory run the project by this line code:
   `python manage.py runserver`
6. Open the dedicated ulr in your browser

include a writeup describing your project, and
specifically your file MUST include all of the following:
Under its own header within the README called Distinctiveness and Complexity:
Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.
What’s contained in each file you created.
How to run your application.
Any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

=>
writing a README.md that you are proud of and that documents your project thoroughly, and that distinguishes this project from others in the course and defends its complexity.

Simply saying, effectively, “It’s different from the other projects and it was complex to build.” is not at all sufficient justification of distinctiveness and complexity.

This section alone should consist of several paragraphs, before you even begin to talk about the documentation of your project.
